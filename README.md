# F173 Biomedical Techniques Virtual Lab

A self-contained, single page virtual lab simulation for practising the AQA Human Biology F173 Biomedical Techniques NEA assessment skills. All data, patients and outcomes are fictional and for educational use only.

## Overview

You play a trainee biomedical scientist at the fictitious **HelixPoint Biomedical Diagnostics Laboratory**. Three virtual patients present with different symptom clusters. For each patient you move through five investigative sections mapped to assessment criterion clusters:

1. **Research & Hypothesis (P1, M1)** – Build focused literature search queries; select evidence; state a likely diagnosis.
2. **Plan & Risk (P2, P3, M2, D1)** – Choose appropriate qualitative and quantitative tests; review method steps and hazards.
3. **Perform & Record (P4, P6, D2)** – Run simplified test simulations (qualitative outcomes, titres, colorimetry calibration data, etc.).
4. **Process & Interpret (P7, P8, M4, M5, D3, D4)** – Calculate means, consider uncertainty, compare to reference ranges, interpret results.
5. **Evaluation & Improvements (P12, M6, D5)** – Reflect on reliability, validity, evidence quality and propose improvements.

An overall score is generated by summing cluster scores, planning quality and research quality (query + evidence + hypothesis). The scoring logic is intentionally lightweight so it can be inspected and adapted.

## Features

- Works fully offline (pure HTML/CSS/JS in `index.html`).
- No external libraries or network calls; all data is embedded for easy teacher editing.
- Research "fake-PubMed" tool with keyword scoring and evidence selection evaluation.
- Mixed qualitative + quantitative test simulations (e.g. Benedict's, colorimetry, titration, chromatography, microscopy).
- Calibration curve SVG rendering with interactive estimation and user feedback.
- MCQ engine supporting single and multi-select questions across sections.
- Accessible markup: semantic landmarks, ARIA labels, focus-visible styles.
- Responsive layout (CSS grid) scaling down to mobile.

## Running the Lab

Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari). No build step required.

```bash
# From repository root
open index.html   # macOS shortcut (or double-click file in Finder)
```

## Project Structure

```text
biomedicaldiagnosis/
├── index.html   # Entire application: HTML, CSS, JS
└── README.md    # This documentation
```

## Customisation (Teacher / Developer)

Edit `index.html` and locate the JavaScript data blocks:

- `articles` – Literature search article metadata (title, abstract, reliability/relevance scores).
- `patientResearchConfig` – Keywords and evaluation gold standards per patient.
- `tests` – Test definitions (id, name, category, method steps, hazards, simulate() function).
- `patients` – Patient demographics, symptoms, recommended tests.
- `mcqBank` – MCQ questions grouped by section (`section1` … `section5`).
- `referenceRanges` – Adjust biological reference values and units.

Each block is clearly commented. After edits simply refresh the browser. No tooling needed.

### Adding a New Test

1. Append an object to the `tests` array with a unique `id`.
1. Provide `category`, `name`, `type` ('qualitative' or 'quantitative'), `method[]`, `hazards[]`.
1. Implement `simulate(ctx)` returning either:

- Qualitative: `{ outcome: 'Description', positive: boolean }`
- Quantitative: keys like `titres` or `{ repeats, absorbances, unit, calib: {x,y}, slope, intercept }`

1. Reference the new test `id` in a patient's `recommendedTests` if desired.

### Adding a New MCQ

Insert into correct section array in `mcqBank`:

```js
{
  id: 'custom-id',
  patient: 'all' | 'A' | 'B' | 'C',
  text: 'Question stem',
  options: ['A', 'B', 'C'],
  correct: 1,          // or [0,2] for multi-select
  multi: true,         // optional
  explanation: 'Rationale',
  cluster: 'P1M1'      // scoring cluster key
}
```

## Scoring Model (Simplified)

- Research query quality: keyword hits vs discouraged terms.
- Evidence selection: correct relevant articles, penalties for irrelevant picks.
- Hypothesis correctness: small bonus.
- Planning score: recommended vs excess/unrelated tests.
- MCQs and data processing interactions increment cluster counters when correct.

You can adjust weightings (e.g., change per-correct points) in helper functions like `addScore()` and evaluation functions.

## Accessibility Notes

- Buttons use `:focus-visible` outline and ARIA attributes for dialog controls.
- Live regions (`aria-live="polite"`) announce score feedback.
- Semantic sections (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, etc.) aid screen reader navigation.

## Disclaimer

All patients, data, and outcomes are **fictional**. This project must **not** be used for real clinical decision-making, diagnosis, or treatment.

## Possible Extensions

- Persist state in `localStorage` for session resume.
- Export summary as JSON or CSV.
- Add additional patient cases loaded from external JSON.
- Integrate a lightweight graphing library if more complex analytics are needed.

## Contributing

Fork and submit pull requests with focused changes (e.g., new tests or question sets). Please keep the single-file approach unless a larger refactor is justified.

## License

No explicit license has been provided by the author. Consider adding one (e.g., MIT) if broader reuse is intended.
